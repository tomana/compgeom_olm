Computational geometry tools for FEM on OLM
--------

The code contained in this repository is built around development versions and [Dolfin](https://bitbucket.org/fenics-project/dolfin) and [libCutFEM](https://bitbucket.org/massing/cutfem), 
with no guarantee of current compatibility.

A large file is included in utils/final-only-cutfem-2d-poisson demonstrating most of the functionality of the framework from within the openFrameworks environment.
